Welcome to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Conference. I'm Robby Ohmes, I cover the large-cap discount stores for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We're very lucky to have Charles Holley, Executive Vice President and CFO for Walmart here with us today. I think most of you are very familiar with Charles. Prior to taking over the CFO position, Charles was Walmart's EVP of Financing and Treasurer. He is also on Walmart's Executive Committee. He has been with Walmart I think since 1994 in several different roles, including the CFO of the International Division, where he led some of Walmart International's merger and acquisition activities. In addition to an amazing 17 or 18-year career so far at Walmart, Charles before that worked more than 10 years at T&A Corp. and Ernst & Young. He's also on the Dean's advisory board from the business i Austin and an active board member for the Cancer Challenge of Northwest Arkansas. Charles, I apologize, I know have left some things out, but I want to give you some time to speak, so I'm very pleased to turn it over to Charles.\"),\n",

And I wanted to know if you can tell us since that seems to be a different approach, it seems to me you're really trying to instill in the minds of customers that you are again the price leader, if that was ever. So can you talk a little bit about what your thinking was going into the market, if you see any success there, I know it's early days, but also if you would plan to roll that out nationwide or other select markets.\"),\n",

Is the strategy to maximize return on invested capital of these stores? Are you  trying to gain market share in underpenetrated markets like the urban centers or what? And if you do go slow on the express side, are you ceding the convenience market to the dollar stores and the Walmart -- and the Walgreen collectively doing well of 1,000 to 2,000 a year?'),\n",
